		<p><strong>Cognitive control</strong> describes the strategic use of a current context to flexibly modulate our responses in line with internal goals. The overarching goal of my research is to examine how memory guides cognitive control—<em>namely, how past experiences and internal goals can shape our responses to demands in our environment, particularly those that require a great deal of attention.</em></p>  

		<p>My research broadly falls under three main questions:</p>

		<p><strong>1. How does learning inform our understanding of cognitive control?</strong></p>

		<p><dl id="attachment_743" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width:300px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-743" src="https://christinabejjani.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/rpjk6503-e1514687799112.jpeg?w=300" alt="Psychonomics2017" width="300" height="279" /></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">I earned <a href="https://www.apadivisions.org/division-3/publications/bulletin/2017/12/poster-winners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 3rd place APA Division 3 Poster Award</a> at Psychonomics 2017.</dd></dl>Do our past experiences inform how we respond to situations that require a lot of attentional focus? For example, people might approach a new situation or environment with a heightened sense of attention, because similar environments have proven difficult in the past. In order for this mechanism to work, people would need to bind together a specific <em>control state</em> (e.g., heightened focus of attention) and their memory of the attentionally demanding environment. In this line of research, I examine how learned contextual cues guide strategic adjustment to attentional demands, showing that people can generalize cognitive strategies across similar contexts, and which brain regions support this type of control-learning. For example publications, see:</p>

		<p><strong>2. How do we learn to form <em>context-sensitive stimulus-response rules (task-sets)</em> from interacting with our environment, and how does this impact our memory?</strong> </p>  

		<dl class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width:300px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-811" src="https://christinabejjani.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cns2019.png" alt="cns2019" width="300" height="279" /></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">I earned a <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CNS-2019-Booklet-compressed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graduate Student Award</a> at Cognitive Neuroscience Society 2019</dd></dl>
		
		<p>In this line of work, I investigate the consequences of learned <em>cognitive flexibility</em> on memory. If people learn to link particular stimuli with specific responses (task-sets) across a variety of environments, do they subsequently remember these stimuli less depending on how the task-set was learned? Can we learn to adapt our cognitive flexibility to match changing attentional demands? What brain regions support learned cognitive flexibility? For example publications, see:</p>

		<p><strong>3. How can we <span style="text-decoration:underline;">apply</span> what we know of <em>cognitive control</em> (and learning & motivation) to improve educational as well as public and mental health outcomes?</strong></p>  

		<p><dl id="attachment_744" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width:300px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-744" src="https://christinabejjani.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/12376645_10100554390084658_5324128855839569509_n.jpg?w=300" alt="CNS2016" width="300" height="279" /></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">I earned <a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/brain-rewire-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Cognitive Neuroscience Society 2016 People's Choice Poster </a> Award.</dd></dl>Prior to my current research at Duke, I was also involved in learning and motivation research. This research investigated how people performed on attention and learning tasks during and after various social manipulations. For example, in one study, we examined whether neural responses to learning from negative feedback change if participants believe that intelligence is a fixed vs. malleable trait and if they are made to feel less competent. In another study, we examined whether participants who write about past failures vs. the plot of a recent movie experience less stress and do better on an attention task following a psychosocial stressor. I am currently following up with this work by applying the psychological research to educational contexts (i.e., scholarship of teaching and learning). The goal, here, is to understand how people learn so as to inform current educational practices. For example publications, see: </p>

		<p><dl id="attachment_743" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width:300px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-743" src="https://christinabejjani.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/psychonomics2018poster.jpg?w=300" alt="psychonomics2018poster" width="300" height="279" /></dt><dd class="wp-caption-dd">I earned a <a href="https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2018GraduateTravelRecipients" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graduate Travel Award</a> at Psychonomics 2018.</dd></dl>In another line of research under this topic, I examine whether individual differences play a role in mental health outcomes. <em>Cognitive control</em> is thought to be altered in many psychiatric disorders, but few studies have examined these deficits in control on a large-scale individual difference level. I recently received a Germinator Grant from the Duke Institute of Brain Sciences to investigate the computational mechanisms underlying individual differences in transdiagnostic deficits in cognitive control. Ask me for more details on this line of work if you're interested. Although the project is preregistered, it's still too early to discuss the larger themes, hypotheses, results, etc.</p>  

		<p>A tangential paper that I worked on before attending Duke examined whether choosing to exert physical effort impacts neural responses to actual effort expenditure. This research can help inform treatments for depression.</p>

		</ul>
		<p>Finally, under this broad goal of applied research, I also examine the real-world consequences of deficits in cognitive control. Multi-tasking is a pervasive public health (and educational) crisis that saps our ability to modulate how we respond to environments in line with our goals. Here, the goal is to apply the research described in Questions 1 and 2 to real-world contexts and test whether research in the lab holds up in our everyday lives as well as ways that we can mitigate the harmful effects of multi-tasking. This research is also in its infancy, so ask me for more details later.</p>
